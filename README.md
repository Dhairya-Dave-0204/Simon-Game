Welcome to the Simon Game Web App! This fun and challenging game is a modern take on the classic Simon game, designed to test your memory and improve your concentration. Our web app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a smooth and engaging experience for players of all ages.

<b> How to Play </b>

Imagine you have four colorful boxes on your screen: red, blue, green, and yellow. These boxes are your playmates in this exciting memory game.

<b> Starting the Game: </b>

When you start the game, one of these four color boxes will light up and make a sound. This is the first step, also known as the first level.

<b> Your Turn: </b>

Your job is to remember which color box lit up and click on it. If you click the right box, you move on to the next level.

<b> Increasing Levels: </b>

In the next level, the game will light up the first box again and then add one more box to the sequence. So, now you will have two boxes lighting up one after the other. Your job is to remember the order and click the boxes in the same sequence.
Every time you get the sequence right, the game will add one more box to the sequence in the next level. This means the sequences will keep getting longer and more challenging as you progress!

<b> Keep Going: </b>

The game keeps going, adding more boxes to the sequence with each level, until you make a mistake. If you click the wrong box, the game ends, and you can start over to try and beat your previous score.

<b> Features </b>
